Whenever there is discrepancy, __firmware is always right__. Alex has written a description of the firmware algorithm [here](figures/EMU_TF_algorithm-1.pdf). \n",

    "In addition, in the course of developing the Phase-2 EMTF algorithm (namely EMTF++), I made another implementation in Python, and can be used outside of CMSSW. I'll denote this as <span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">\"fastsim\"</span>. The main reason I do this is because (i) it's very tedious to work with the emulator directly, and (ii) it allows me to use certain powerful Python libraries directly <sup><a href=\"#myfootnote1\">[1]</a></sup>. Basically, I have made simple ntuples and I can run Python scripts on them to do analysis much more quickly (instead of going through the full-blown CMSSW). It allows me to make experiments more quickly.\n",

    "Due to latency in receiving the RPC hits from CPPF, RPC hits are not included in pattern matching. Due to possible BX misidentification, all the CSC hits from 2 consecutive BX's are used (since June 2018). The boundaries of the 4 zones are (0, 41, 49, 87, 127) in terms of the integer &theta; unit. To ensure coverage near the boundaries, an overlap of 2 units is allocated. E.g. CSC hits with &theta; from 0 to 43 are included in zone 0, and CSC hits with &theta; from 40 to 51 are included in zone 1, and so on.\n",

In the asymmetric case, patterns of straightness 0-3 also have their mirrors, so there are 9 patterns in total. The unit used in pattern matching is a coarser &#981; unit, which is internally called \"quad-strip\". The scale of the quad-strip unit is approx 0.5&deg;, which is 32x coarser than the integer &#981; unit described previously (1/8-strip).\n",
