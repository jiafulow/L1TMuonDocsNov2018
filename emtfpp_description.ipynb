    "\n",
    "While EMTF is really one algorithm, it is implemented in __two__ different ways: (i) firmware, written in Verilog and implemented in the MTF7 board; (ii) emulator, written in C++ and implemented as part of CMSSW software ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/master/L1Trigger/L1TMuonEndCap)). In the perfect world, they should be identical, but this is not always the case, and it is very important to recognize this fact when referring to the details of the EMTF algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, I will try my best to be clear about which algorithm is being discussed. I'll denote the firmware algorithm as simply <span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">\"firmware\"</span>, and the emulator algorithm as <span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">\"emulator\"</span>. Whenever there is discrepancy, __firmware is always right__. Alex has written a description of the firmware algorithm [here](figures/EMU_TF_algorithm-1.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in the course of developing the Phase-2 EMTF algorithm (namely EMTF++), I made another implementation in Python, and can be used outside of CMSSW. I'll denote this as <span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">\"fastsim\"</span>. The main reason I do this is because (i) it's very tedious to work with the emulator directly, and (ii) it allows me to use certain powerful Python libraries directly <sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup>. Basically, I have made simple ntuples and I can run Python scripts on them much more quickly (instead of going through the full-blown CMSSW). It allows me to make changes more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"myfootnote1\"><sup>1</sup></a>   I found the scientific stack in Python very powerful. These are the libraries I have used in my study: rootpy, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow.\n",
