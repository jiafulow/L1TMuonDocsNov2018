Whenever there is discrepancy, __firmware is always right__. Alex has written a description of the firmware algorithm [here](docs/EMU_TF_algorithm-1.docx). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in the course of developing the Phase-2 EMTF algorithm (namely EMTF++), I made another implementation in Python, and can be used outside of CMSSW. I'll denote this as <span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\">\"fastsim\"</span>. The main reason I do this is because (i) it's very tedious to work with the emulator directly, and (ii) it allows me to use certain powerful Python libraries directly <sup><a href=\"#myfootnote1\">[1]</a></sup>. Basically, I have made simple ntuples and I can run Python scripts on them to do analysis much more quickly (instead of going through the full-blown CMSSW). It allows me to make experiments more quickly.\n",

I multiply it by 4 (arbitrarily) before quantization, which should fit into 7 bits (-64 to 63). Since the CSC comparator digis are in half-strip unit, the bend is in 1/8-strip unit.

    "The trajectory of a muon as it passes through the endcap muon stations is bent by the magnetic field. Muons with low p<sub>T</sub> are bent more compared to muons with high p<sub>T</sub>. Note that as the magnetic field diminishes at large z, there is very little bending of the muon trajectories in the outer stations even for low p<sub>T</sub> muons. In EMTF, we use patterns of different straightness to detect muons by matching hits to the patterns. Each sector is divided into 4 \"zones\" (0-3) along the &theta; direction, and pattern matching is done in each zone. Multiple patterns may be activated (\"fired\") by the same hits, so a ghost busting step is done after pattern matching to get rid of the duplicates (\"ghosts\").\n",

    "Due to latency in receiving the RPC hits from CPPF, RPC hits are not included in pattern matching. Due to possible BX misidentification, all the CSC hits from 2 consecutive BX's are used (since June 2018). The boundaries of the 4 zones are (0, 41, 49, 87, 127) in terms of the integer &theta; unit. To ensure coverage near the boundaries, an overlap of 2 units is allocated. E.g. CSC hits with &theta; from 0 to 43 are included in zone 0, and CSC hits with &theta; from 40 to 51 are included in zone 1, and so on.\n",

The unit used in pattern matching is a coarser &#981; unit, which is internally called \"quad-strip\". The scale of the quad-strip unit is approx 0.5&deg;, which is 32x coarser than the integer &#981; unit described previously (1/8-strip).\n",

    "A \"v1\" version of EMTF++ has been implemented. It has achieved 11.0 kHz at 20 GeV trigger threshold for &lt;PU&gt;=200, which is a factor of 4 rate reduction. In the |&eta;| > 1.6 region with the new Phase 2 muon detectors, the rate reduction is 6x. At the same time, the overall efficiency is also higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it falls short of the goal to reduce the rate below 10 kHz at &lt;PU&gt;=200. However, I'm sure further improvements/optimizations can be made. Also, certain assumptions in this v1 version might be difficult to implement in the firmware, or maybe there are bugs, so it might still need to be reworked and debugged. In any case, we now have a new baseline that can be used as the benchmark for future studies, which I think is the most important point. For example, if one were to develop a new algorithm (e.g. Kalman Filter) for the endcap muon trigger, they might want to find out how good the new algorithm is compared to the old one.\n",

    "The NN p<sub>T</sub> assignment is a very interesting technology to be applied at L1 trigger. We plan to make it ready for Run 3 (not to replace the BDT-based p<sub>T</sub> assignment, but as an exercise to investigate the feasibility of NNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can also extend EMTF++ to trigger on new scenario, such as displaced muons, or new detector region, such as the OMTF region. "
