    "### EMTF firmware, emulator, fastsim\n",
    "\n",
    "While EMTF is really one algorithm, it is implemented in __two__ different ways: (i) firmware, written in Verilog and implemented in the MTF7 board (Refs. [JINST 8 (2013) C12034](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1627822), [JINST 12 (2017) C07010](http://cds.cern.ch/record/2264997)); (ii) emulator, written in C++ and implemented as part of CMSSW software ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/master/L1Trigger/L1TMuonEndCap)). In the perfect world, they should be identical, but this is not always the case, and it is very important to recognize this fact when referring to the details of the EMTF algorithm. Whenever there are discrepancies, __firmware is always right__. A [description of the firmware algorithm](docs/EMU_TF_algorithm-1.docx) has been written by Alex Madorsky. The job of the emulator is to match the firmware behaviors as closely as possible. But certain differences are very difficult to avoid, and I'll try my best to explain any differences between the firmware algorithm and the emulator algorithm. (An exact implementation of the firmware algorithm in C++ is possible, and it was done for CSCTF, but it would be very difficult for any physicists to help develop and debug the algorithm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in the course of developing the Phase-2 EMTF algorithm (namely EMTF++), I made another implementation in Python, that can be used outside of CMSSW. I'll call this the __\"fastsim\"__ algorithm. The reasons I did this are (i) it's very time-consuming to work with the emulator directly as it requires re-processing large samples, and (ii) it allows me to use certain powerful Python libraries directly <sup><a href=\"#myfootnote1\">[1]</a></sup>. Basically, I have made simple ntuples and I can run Python scripts on them to do analysis much more quickly. This allows me to do a lot more experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"myfootnote1\"><sup>1</sup></a>   I found the scientific stack in Python very powerful. These are the libraries I have used in my study: rootpy, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow.\n",

    "EMTF is a successor of CSCTF. It was installed during Phase-1 upgrade and running since 2016. See [Phase-1 L1 Trigger Upgrade TDR](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1556311/) for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMTF system consists of 12 sector processors &mdash; 6 for each endcap, 1 for each 60&deg; trigger sector (at 15&deg;, 75&deg;, ...). Each sector works independently. To ensure coverage near the sector boundaries, each sector N also shares certain chambers with the neighbor sector N+1. Thus, although it is nominally 60&deg;, each sector actually covers 70&deg; in the rings with 10&deg;-wide chambers, or 80&deg; in the rings with 20&deg;-wide chambers.\n",

    "\n",
    "EMTF covers the &eta; region from 1.24 to 2.4. In Phase-1, EMTF receives two types of trigger primitives: <span style=\"color: #31bd38\">&#11035;</span> __CSC__ and <span style=\"color: #0096ff\">&#11035;</span> __RPC__ hits. In Phase-2, EMTF++ will receive additional <span style=\"color: #e63600\">&#11035;</span> __GEM__, <span style=\"color: #9437ff\">&#11035;</span> __iRPC__ and <span style=\"color: #ffa25f\">&#11035;</span> __ME0__ trigger primitives. But, GE1/1 in particular will be installed and running after LS2. Muon momenta are measured from the &#981; and &eta; coordinates of these trigger primitives as the muons traverse the endcap disks in the non-uniform magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMTF algorithm starts by receiving the hits, or trigger primitives, and ends by producing muon tracks with reconstructed information: (most importantly) p<sub>T</sub> , &eta;, &#981;, track quality, and its associated hits. I'll break the EMTF algorithm into 4 building blocks and describe how they work. Each block may consist of smaller blocks.\n",

    "EMTF++ is an extension of the EMTF algorithm, and it follows the same design. For each block, I will explain how it works in EMTF, and then explain what are changed for EMTF++. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that at the moment, EMTF++ only builds <b>\"SingleMu\"</b>-quality tracks &mdash; these are tracks that have at least 3 hits in 3 different stations, and at least one of the hits must be in ME1. Building tracks of lower quality can be added in the future. \n",

    ", we will be using the same primitive conversion modules that are already in the firmware and in the emulator. In addition, we want to add a new __bend__ variable, if it is possible to do in the TMB. TAMU and UCLA have shown that doing a least squares fit to the CLCT comparator digis can improve the &#981; position of each LCT (see Andrew Peck's [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/712513/contributions/2959915/attachments/1630667/2599369/20180410_otmb_pattern_logic.pdf)).

    "\n",
    "Basically, consider there are up to 6 hits in the 6 layers of the CSC detector. One can do a simple linear fit with <i>x</i> = layer number and <i>y</i> = hit &#981;. Extract the slope of the fit and multiply it by 6 to obtain the new bend variable. The result is a floating-point value. I multiply it by 4 (arbitrarily) before quantization. As the CSC comparator digis are in half-strip unit, the bend is in 1/8-strip unit. It should fit into 7 bits (-64 to 63). But, it is only useful for ME1/1 and ME1/2 (see slides 7-9 in my [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759873/contributions/3151457/subcontributions/264210/attachments/1722105/2780661/2018-09-25_phase2_emtf_v1.pdf))."

    "A \"v1\" version of EMTF++ has been implemented. It has achieved 11.0 kHz at 20 GeV trigger threshold for &lt;PU&gt;=200, which is a factor of 4 rate reduction. In the |&eta;| > 1.6 region with the new Phase-2 muon detectors, the rate reduction is close to 6x. At the same time, the overall efficiency has been improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it falls short of the goal to reduce the rate below 10 kHz at &lt;PU&gt;=200. However, I'm sure further improvements/optimizations can be made. Also, certain assumptions in this v1 version might be difficult to implement in the firmware, or maybe there are bugs, so it might still need to be reworked or debugged. In any case, we now have a new baseline that can be used as the benchmark for future studies, which I think is the most important point. For example, if one were to develop a new algorithm (e.g. Kalman Filter) for the endcap muon trigger, they might want to find out how good the new algorithm is compared to the old one.\n",
